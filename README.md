Easy Testimonial PHP Software

This is just a copy - paste code to include testimonials on any website.

This script uses file storage, but I recommend hooking it up to a mySQL if you have enougth time, but you can stick to file storage if you're comfortable with it. 

You can find the demo here : http://easy-development.com/testimonial_demo/

This script uses Twitter Bootstrap.

This isn't a "master piece" testimonial software, but it's something basic you can adapt for your needs.
